## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the score in the 1st inning and match outcomes (win prediction) in the 2nd inning of IPL matches. The main goals are:

Score Prediction (1st Inning): Estimating the final score based on real-time match data up until a certain point in the first innings using Logistic Regression.
Win Prediction (2nd Inning): Predicting the likelihood of a win for either team in the second innings based on the current match progress using a RandomForestClassifier.
The project uses machine learning models trained on historical IPL data and various match features like overs, wickets, runs, venue, and player statistics.

## Results & Visualizations
The project provides visualizations for:

Predicted score trends vs actual scores for 1st innings.
Win probability curves for teams in the 2nd innings.
These visualizations help in understanding how the models perform in real-time predictions.

## Future Work
Improve model accuracy by adding more advanced features like individual player stats, weather conditions, and match importance.
Implement real-time data fetching and model inference during live IPL matches.
