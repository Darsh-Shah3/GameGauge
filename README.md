## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the score in the 1st inning and match outcomes (win prediction) in the 2nd inning of IPL matches. The main goals are:

Score Prediction (1st Inning): Estimating the final score based on real-time match data up until a certain point in the first innings using Logistic Regression.
Win Prediction (2nd Inning): Predicting the likelihood of a win for either team in the second innings based on the current match progress using a RandomForestClassifier.
The project uses machine learning models trained on historical IPL data and various match features like overs, wickets, runs, venue, and player statistics.
